Types of games I'm interested in developing:

1. Title: Footprint

A linear puzzle game in which time goes backward starting from half an hour. When time expires, the game restarts. With each playthrough the player will learn more about the story and how to get to the finish line. The player is encouraged to leave reminders for his/her future self using objects provided at the start of the game.

* Camera: First person


2. Title: Town Defense

A resource gathering/city building strategy game. Similar to WarCraft 3, heavily focused on allocating human resources to the right places (wood, gold, food, iron, etc.) and defending your city from invaders/animals.

* Camera: Isometric


3. Title: Mission Frontier

A narrative survival game. Set in the far future when humans are already colonizing other planets. The player is sent to uncover what happened to the space crew that flew to investigate a small planet. Upon arrival, the player discovers that there might be other life on this planet.

* Camera: First person
